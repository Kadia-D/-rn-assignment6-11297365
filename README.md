 # Design Choices

# Grid Layout for Products:
Products are displayed in a grid layout using a FlatList with numColumns set to 2. This layout allows users to view multiple products side by side, providing a visually appealing and efficient browsing experience.

# Overlay Add Button:
An "Add to Cart" button is overlaid on each product image at the bottom-right corner. 

# Styling:
Simple and clean styles are used to make the app look modern and user-friendly. The use of margins, padding, and flex properties ensures a responsive layout.

# Data Storage
I used AsyncStorage for storing cart items locally on the device. This allows for  user selections to be saved even if the app is closed and reopened.
